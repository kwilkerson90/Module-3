    <h1>Kendra "The Great" Wilkerson</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        I am Kendra Wilkerson. I'm originally from Chicago, but I've been living in Atlanta long enough to consider myself 
        half peach. I am currently a student in the DigitalCrafts web development bootcamp. Upon completion, I will be a 
        fullstack web developer. I love STEM, but I have a soft spot for Biology and Tech. 
        <br>
        What excites me about web development is that it is ever-evolving, dynamic, challenging, and allows me to be creative. 
        My hobbies are exercising, cooking, reading, crocheting, being out in nature, traveling and spending time with my dog.
