# Module-3
The Module 3 repo holds projects/exercises written in HTML and CSS. These are starter projects that were mainly used to build muscle memory and get comfortable 
writing in these programming languages. For example, the March2 file was created with instructions to make a basic to-do list. I linked an external CSS file for 
the first time. I also modified the styling of the list.
